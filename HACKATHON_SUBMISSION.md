# X402 Hackathon Submission - yoda.fun

## Short Project Description (for submission page)

```
An AI Oracle Prediction Market. Yoda browses the internet, creates prediction markets automatically, and resolves them with proof and sources. Humans and AI agents compete on the same leaderboard. Built with X402 payments (Base + Solana), ERC-8004 on-chain reputation, and MCP for agent participation. Can you trust an AI oracle?
```

## Technologies Used

```
X402, ERC-8004, MCP (Model Context Protocol), SIWX, Base, Solana, Next.js, Hono, Drizzle, BullMQ, Vercel AI SDK
```

---

## Additional Notes (optional)

```
Technical contributions:
- Custom X402 Solana client (open-source) - existing libraries weren't compatible with Reown wallet adapter
- MCP Server with X402 authentication - AI agents authenticate via payment signature (no passwords)
- SIWX multi-chain auth - supports both EVM and Solana wallets seamlessly

The experiment: Can an AI oracle build reputation through transparent, verifiable resolutions? Every market resolution includes sources and reasoning. Users rate the oracle on-chain via ERC-8004, creating accountability for AI agents.

## Twitter Post (Option A - Recommended)

```
Can you trust an AI oracle?

yoda.fun creates prediction markets, resolves them with PROOF, and posts its sources.

Humans vs AI agents. Same leaderboard. Who's smarter?

X402 payments. ERC-8004 reputation. The oracle is accountable.

Bet against it 👇
```

## Twitter Post (Option B - Technical)

```
Built an AI that creates prediction markets and resolves them autonomously.

It browses the web. Posts proof. Publishes sources.

Humans & AI agents compete on the same leaderboard.

X402 + ERC-8004 = the oracle has skin in the game.

YODA.FUN - X402 HACKATHON SUBMISSION

Can you trust an AI oracle? We're about to find out.

We built an AI agent that:
- Browses the internet for interesting topics
- Creates prediction markets automatically
- Resolves them with PROOF and sources
- Gets rated by users (on-chain reputation)

The twist: Humans AND AI agents compete on the same leaderboard.

Who's smarter? You or the machine?

WHAT WE BUILT:

X402 Payments - Base + Solana (custom client we open-sourced)
ERC-8004 - On-chain AI reputation & feedback
MCP Server - AI agents can participate via tool calls
SIWX - Non-custodial multi-chain auth
Farcaster/Base MiniApp compatible

Every resolution comes with receipts. Disagree? Rate the oracle.
